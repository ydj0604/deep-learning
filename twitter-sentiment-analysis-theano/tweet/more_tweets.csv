The readings from Prof Abrego and connecting that w/ the film we watched in class makes the whole immigration journey more real #CCS10B #1M,,,,
The stories that Professor Abrego writes in her book are heart wrenching and makes me want to stand by those people. #CCS10B #1M,,,,
One of the most heartbreaking things about immigration is the separation between children and their parents. #CCS10B #1M,,,,
I love how there is hope for the immigrants through people who don't have much but are willing to give what they do have #CCS10B #1M,,,,
What if instead of worrying so much about immigration policies we try to fix the initial problem these families are facing #CCS10B #1M,,,,
It was not okay that little girls were hurt and abused in the process of immigration. It doesn't make sense. #CCS10B #1M,,,,
Women &amp; men had similar yet such different reason a why they migrated to the States. It's crazy how gender affects these things. #CCS10B #1M,,,,
We are taught that immigrants come to find the American Dream but there is a deeper reason why these people had to come. #CCS10B #1M,,,,
